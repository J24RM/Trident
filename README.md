# Pokedex in C++

## üìå Description
This program implements an **interactive Pokedex** in C++. It allows you to:
- Load a list of Pok√©mon from a file (`pokemons.txt`).  
- Add new Pok√©mon and save them to the file.  
- Display the list of registered Pok√©mon.  
- Automatically keep the list sorted by Pok√©dex number using **Merge Sort**.  

The program simulates Professor Oak‚Äôs Pokedex, showing a simple menu to interact with the registered Pok√©mon.

## Compilation and Execution

To compile:  
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o main
```

To run:

```bash
./main
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Important: the pokemons.txt file must be in the same folder as main.cpp and the executable.

üéØ # Competencies Developed
## SICT0301: Evaluate Components

A complexity analysis of the Merge Sort algorithm was performed:

-Best case: O(n log n)

-Average case: O(n log n)

-Worst case: O(n log n)

This guarantees efficient sorting of Pok√©mon even as the list grows.

## SICT0302: Decision Making

Algorithm selection:
For this program, Merge Sort was chosen because:

-It is an efficient and stable algorithm for sorting objects.

-Its worst case is better than algorithms such as Bubble Sort or Insertion Sort.
